# Insurance Claim Prediction

## Overview
The Insurance Claim Prediction project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze insurance data and predict claim occurrences. This helps in risk assessment and decision-making for insurance companies.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses insurance data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses supervised learning to predict claims.
- **Web Application**: Provides an interactive interface for users.
- **Model Deployment**: Integrates a trained model (`model.pkl`) for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for web application)
- **scikit-learn** (for model training)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)

## Usage
- Upload or enter insurance data.
- Click "Predict" to determine the likelihood of a claim.
- View results and insights.

## Dataset
The project uses `insurance3r2.csv`, which includes various factors affecting insurance claims.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms.
- Expand dataset for better generalization.
- Implement user authentication for personalized insights.
